4.  In main loop, first vertical blank then horizontal blank.
5.  Overscan at the end of main loop, along with program reset and interrupt vector words.
6.  Visible scanlines should be in section named as such.
7.  Next background color, then playfield color and layout.
8.  Use subroutines at least for horiztonal positioning.
